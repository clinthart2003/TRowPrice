Works in Python 2.7 and 3.8
This file contains two methods that return a list of the results.  the long_workd_counter method returns the longest word in a sentance with the lenght of that word.  The shrot_workd_counter method returns the shortest word in the sentance, ignoring the words "the" and "a".  Both methods take a single argument which is a string.  All puncutation will be stripped from the sentance.  The script will run with unittests as is.   If you wnat to import to another script, example:

import from TRowTest long_word_counter

results = (long_word_counter(sentance='The cow jumped over the moon.'))
print (results)
['jumped', 6] 


There is a python script that runs 4 different tests.... from and IDE or python terminal run: "python Unit_Test.py".    The example test script has an intentional failure to show the eles: statement will execute.
