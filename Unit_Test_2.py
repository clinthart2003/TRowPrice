    This is a condensed version of a set of tests that uses 1 method for execution.  the
    lists "test_sentances_long" and "test_sentances_short" contains a list of sentances to test. 
    The expected word and its length are part of the list and used for comparison.

    Example results:
    test Passed: jumped, 6
    test Passed: cow, 3
    Test Failed: Add, 3  expected: Sentance, 8
